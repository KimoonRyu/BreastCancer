Breast Cancer Prediction using Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) Biopsy Data (R)

Comprehensive overview of data mining techniques used in all data mining stages, including traditional statistical 
analysis and clustering machine learning techniques. Breast Cancer prediction using Wisconsin (Diagnostic) fine needle 
aspirate (FNA) biopsy data to determine if sample results are malignant or benign. 
Completed all data mining stages including data preparation and modeling. Made decision trees and 
k-nearest neighbors (KNN) clustering models. Because the KNN model had the highest 
specificity (you do not want to miss any samples testing positive for the malignant tumor even if they 
turn out to be false positives), it was deemed the best model for my project.
